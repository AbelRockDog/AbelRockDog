Hiya! I'm Abel. I'm a lycanroc who should not have been given unsupervised internet access.

I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. If you end up using anything I've made, God help you.

The things I do make are most likely really shitty plugins for SCP: Secret Laboratory; it's the only way I was able to force myself to learn C#.

My discord is AbelLycanroc if you would like to contact me and/or submit any feedback.
